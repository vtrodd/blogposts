# My new car

When I first started my new contract at CERN, I was in the market for a car.  I found an old VW Golf estate being sold by someone at CERN, and after a quick test drive, I agreed to buy it for just under â‚¬1000:

What no one told me was there was about to be a flurry of work to do for me to own this car and be allowed to drive it.

Step one was getting insurance. This was easy, there seem to be a million different places in town where I could do this, so I picked the one I was recommended by the previous owner of the car.  Very nice people there, and this was all sorted relatively quickly for â‚¬400 or so for the year.  The only strange part is that they had to fake the year that I passed my driving test because their system wouldn't accept that I'd passed it when I was 17. Let's hope that never becomes an issue if I have to claim on my insurance.

With that done, step two was getting the [Green Plates](https://admin-eguide.web.cern.ch/en/procedure/green-plates) taken off of the car, and the original French numberplates put back on.  I went and bought the French plates locally and had them fitted for about â‚¬50 (they're riveted on instead of screwed on like in the UK).  I'll also say now, it's been a while since this all happened, and more recently I found that next to the spare tyre in the car is a box containing the same French plates from before the Green plates were ever put on...  I then had to take the Green plates to the customs office to hand them in and complete the next step of this process.

Step three and four were no fun either.  At the customs office, I had to wait around for a while whilst some documents were checked, printed, duplicated, and a card machine produced.  These documents were just about confirming that the plates had been changed to French ones, essentially importing the car from the grey area of CERN back into France, costing â‚¬300 for the privilige.  Bear in mind the car isn't even in my name yet!  No, to get it into my name took a trip to another office where a nice man was able to type some things into a computer, have me sign a piece of paper and hand over â‚¬200 (granted, this also covers the car tax for as long as I own the car, unlike the annual payment in the UK).

Finally, the car was completely mine and everything was sorted and lovely and I can get on with life, right?  Not yet ðŸ˜­ because to get the new logbook, the car needed a valid MOT, which it didn't have because of a crazy exemption rule that comes with having Green plates.  Another â‚¬100 later, the car has had its MOT and of course failed because it hasn't had one in, I think, 9 years!  All four tyres needed changing, and the brake discs and pads were all worn down big time and needed replacing.  Getting the tyres done was â‚¬120 with a local garage, and I asked them for a quote to do the brakes, and they wanted to charge me â‚¬710 to get it done!  This brings me to the next part of my journey:

# A foray into doing-it-all-myself-to-save-money car repairs.

It was a stroke of luck that I asked the garage for a quote and that they sent it to me as a PDF, where they listed all of the parts they were going to use, as well as their crazy idea of how much they would all cost.  I found everything online for â‚¬150 (compared to their â‚¬530), and paid for an annual membership to the CERN Car Club (â‚¬60) to be able to go and use the hydraulic lift.  If I had been more organised, I would have asked about tools when I booked out my timeslot for the lift, but instead I left it too late and had to buy some of the things I needed (another â‚¬50..., but these tools have come in very useful since doing this).

## Saturday 23rd March 2024; Or, The Most Stressful Day Of My Life So Far

I booked out a three hour timeslot to get all four sets of discs and pads replaced, starting at noon.  I arrived on time and set to work, and immediately encountered my first problem.  I think the garage that changed my tyres had it out for me after I turned down their quote to change the brakes, because each and every bolt on all four wheels was tightened beyond my strength.  I spent some time trying different ways of loosening the bolts, eventually gave up and had my first stroke of luck.  Someone had arrived at the car club to hoover their car, and I asked if he would have a go at getting the wheels off.  He was more than happy to oblige, and it turned out he was an ex-mechanic. He managed to get all of the bolts off through an incredible feat of strength.  The wheels were off, the car was up on the lift, so I thanked him and he was on his way.

I started on the front wheels and made some good progress.  I got the pads off, then found that the screw holding the brake discs in place was tight and rounded off, on both sides.  It took a while, but I eventually drilled them out and got the discs off.  These screws would have been nice to have, but they were not fundamentally necessary.  Fitting the new discs and pads on the front wheels went smoothly after this.

The back wheels presented more problems.  With each bolt that I tried to take off, I found it too tight to come off with the hand tools that I had.  I think by now, I was long past the three hours that I had booked the lift for...  Someone arrived at the club to change their motorbike's oil, so as I did with the wheels earlier on, I asked if this person could try and get some of these stubborn bolts off.  They had come prepared, and with their bigger tools (and still a lot of fighting with the bolts), all but one of the bolts were off.  The final one took absolutely forever to give in, but we eventually got there and I left my new friend to their oil change.  Once again, I drilled out the screws keeping the discs in place, used a crowbar to pry them away from the car (and to think I was ridiculed by someone for suggesting I might need a crowbar for this job??) and started fitting the new parts.

I'm not sure how universal this is, but on my Golf's rear brake pads, there's a piston which should be reset when you change the pads.  This is done with a special tool which pushes the piston back in whilst rotating it.  I didn't have this tool.  I had a small C-clamp, and a pair of molegrips.  With an extra set of hands to help me, we were able to tighten the clamp and rotate the piston head with the molegrips at the same time, replicating the special tool.  This was slow work, but eventually the pistons were depressed enough that I could get the new brake pads into place.

From this point onwards, it was smooth sailing.  I quickly changed the handbrake cables too, which was a nice easy job in comparison to everything else, and got everything finished up.  I had worked alongside another guy for the whole day mostly in silence, both of us stopping now and then to take a break from the crazy jobs we were doing, and had the car back on the road at 8pm.  I had spent an entire work day getting this job done to avoid paying a garage an extra â‚¬450.  I would say that's not half bad, especially for my first time doing anything like this.  I got home, looked in the mirror, and my arms were all black, my face covered in black, and my clothes all smeared with black marks, and after a bath, these black marks were transferred to the bathtub and eventually washed away.

I took the car back to the MOT centre the next day, spent another â‚¬30 to have it re-tested, and now the car is in good shape.

Right?

# How wrong I was

A little over a week after all of this was done, and the car had been running perfectly fine, I was driving down to the Three Valleys, and about 5 minutes from the resort we were staying at, the car suddenly made a loud thunk, and it felt like I was driving with the handbrake on.  I pulled over, couldn't work out what the problem was, and waited for a friend to come and take a look.  Their assessment was that the brakes had seized, so we let them cool down (after a slightly burned finger), and tried to get the car going again.  It was fine for about a minute, then we had the same problem.  We were able to do this cycle a few times so we could get the car to a lay-by, and left it there for the night.

The next day, we did the same thing, just to get the car up to the resort, and I scrambled to find a mechanic that could come and help.  One did, and he lifted the car up, took one quick look behind the offending wheel, and was able to say that a bolt was missing - it had likely fallen out and caused the loud thunk - so the brake caliper was only held on by one bolt now and had swung away from the brake disc.  Not seized at all!  I spent a few hours trying to source a very specific bolt for a 20-year-old car, and eventually found one in a VW dealership 40 minutes away.  Having fitted the new bolt, I gave the mechanic â‚¬120.  To change a bolt.  ðŸ¥²  Not like I had much choice at the top of a mountain.  The car was fine after this.

# What is the moral here?

I've been through a lot with this car in the past 4 months I've owned it, and considering all of the other cars I've looked at here have been over â‚¬2,500 at least, maybe the Golf has still come out as an okay deal.  Unless I'm bad at maths, it's come to about â‚¬2,000 plus a good amount of hard work and stress.  All I can do now is hope and pray that nothing else goes wrong (considering I've written this at the end of May and just backdated it for the sake of relevancy, this is absolutely terrible foreshadowing for what's to come).  

Maybe the moral of the story is don't buy the cheapest car you can possibly find.  Maybe it's that I shouldn't be trusted to repair a car.  Or maybe, just maybe, it's that we are much more capable than we think we are.  Before now, I don't think I would ever have considered attempting to change the brakes on a car, but after seeing the costs of this Golf keep accumulating, I was convinced to give it a go.  Apart from the mishap with the missing bolt, I think it was a job well done, and I've not only impressed myself but a lot of people around me.  It has also been a massive learning experience for me, and I am now more inclined to allow myself to do work on a car than pay extortionate rates to have someone in a garage do it for me.

But wow can it be stressful at times.
